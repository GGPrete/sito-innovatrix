					<p>Steve Jobs, born in San Francisco, was one of the greatest entrepreneurs of all time. He founded Apple in April 1976, and by 1980, Apple went public, reaching a valuation of $256 million, thus creating the first Apple computers in history. Additionally, in 1986, he acquired Pixar Animation Studios, becoming the founder and CEO of the film production company. Jobs had a marketing idea based on several points: a focus on customer experience, simplicity and clarity, continuous innovation, creating emotional connections. These principles allowed him to win over customers and people, enabling him to sell his products. If Steve succeeded in reaching where he did, it was because he had an incredible mindset based on principles such as pursuing passion, always making a difference, embracing failure, trusting his instincts, and living in the present. These principles made him the entrepreneur he was. Unfortunately, he passed away in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, despite his continuous struggles with the disease. His death would later be commemorated worldwide.
